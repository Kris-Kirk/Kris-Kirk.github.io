  <p>Hi, my name is Kris and I am an eager learner who enjoys finding creative solutions to challenging problems. As a creative thinker who can learn and apply knowledge quickly, I have chosen to pursue Engineering Physics at UBC. Within the Engineering Physics program, I focus on developing a strong foundation of advanced math and physics, while taking courses on Mechanical, Electrical, and Software Engineering, in order to become a well-rounded individual with a background in a variety of disciplines.

    When I am not at pursuing Engineering, I enjoy coaching swimming and diving. I am the Head Coach and the Assistant Head Coach of the Diving and Swimming programs for the North Vancouver Cruisers Aquatics Club.</p>
